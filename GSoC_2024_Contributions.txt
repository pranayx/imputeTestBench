Introduction
The imputetestbench package has been significantly updated to enhance its functionality, performance, and usability. The recent improvements focus on expanding support to multivariate time series, improving computational performance, integrating advanced imputation methods, and providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating and comparing imputation techniques. This document outlines all the changes made to the package, highlighting the new features, optimizations, and enhancements.

Key Updates and Enhancements

1. Support for Multivariate Time Series
Adaptation for Multivariate Data:
The package now supports multivariate time series, allowing users to evaluate imputation methods across multiple time series simultaneously. This update required significant changes to the core functions to handle multivariate datasets.
Enhanced Plotting Capabilities:
Functions such as plot_errors() and plot_impute() have been updated to handle multivariate data, providing clear visualizations of imputation performance across multiple series.

2. Performance Improvements
Integration with data.table:
The package has been optimized by integrating data.table for faster data manipulation. This is particularly beneficial when working with large datasets, as it significantly reduces processing time.
Parallel Processing:
Introduced parallel processing capabilities using foreach and doParallel, enabling the package to perform imputation and error calculations across multiple cores. This enhancement dramatically improves computational speed, especially for large-scale simulations.

3. Advanced Imputation Methods
Embedding State-of-the-Art Techniques:
The package now includes support for advanced imputation methods, particularly those tailored for genomic and high-dimensional datasets. Users can now evaluate these state-of-the-art techniques alongside traditional methods.
Custom Imputation Methods:
Users can define and integrate their own imputation methods within the package, providing flexibility to test novel algorithms or domain-specific approaches.

4. Improved Error Metrics and Evaluation
Custom Error Functions:
The package now supports user-defined error metrics, allowing for more tailored evaluations based on the specific needs of the analysis. This flexibility is crucial for specialized applications where standard error metrics may not suffice.
Enhanced Reporting:
The impute_errors() function has been updated to provide more detailed output, including comprehensive summaries of error metrics for each method and scenario.

6. Performance Optimization and Scalability
Apache Spark Integration:
For users working with very large datasets, the package now integrates with Apache Spark through the SparkR package. This enables distributed data processing, making it feasible to perform imputation tests on massive time series data.
Caching Mechanism:
Implemented a caching mechanism to store results from common computations, reducing the need for repeated calculations and improving overall performance.

7. Testing and Quality Assurance
Expanded Test Coverage:
The test suite has been expanded to include a wider range of scenarios, particularly focusing on edge cases, multivariate data, and parallel processing. This ensures that the package remains robust and reliable under diverse conditions.
Cross-Validation:
Results have been cross-validated with other imputation frameworks to ensure consistency and accuracy across different methods and data types.

8. Versioning and Release Notes
Version 4.0.0:
The package version has been updated to 4.0.0 to reflect the comprehensive enhancements. Detailed release notes accompany this version, summarizing all the changes and improvements made.
